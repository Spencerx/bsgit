I have added support for pushing simple changes to the build service as well 
now.

Note that the build service cannot represent things like authorship (vs. who 
committed a change), subdirectories, symlinks and other non-regular files, 
file modes, or merges.  Pushing to the build service will REWRITE THE GIT 
HISTORY to what the build service can represent; any additional information 
will be lost.  Source links cannot be pushed either, yet.  (I depend on some 
backend changes both to ensure that source links can always be imported, and 
that they can be exported cleanly.)

Cheers,
Andreas
