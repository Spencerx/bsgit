Please see doc/announce*.txt for the release announcements of bsgit from its
inception until its current state.  The project was introduced at the openSUSE
conference 2009; see doc/git-in-the-build-service.pdf for the slides used.

There also was a Google Summer Of Code project for implementing a git backend
for the build service which unfortunately failed.  Some documentation for that
project can be found at http://en.opensuse.org/Build_Service/Git_Backend.
